Painted Worlds

Painted Worlds is an atmospheric 3D cozy puzzle game in which the player steps inside paintings to restore their lost harmony. Colors are missing, objects feel out of place, and the artist’s muse has vanished, leaving his creative world in chaos. The player’s goal is to repair the paintings from the inside and bring the story to a peaceful conclusion.

About the Game

Ever felt like a masterpiece was missing its soul?

In Painted Worlds, the player takes on the role of a determined artist whose creative world has been disrupted. His muse has fled, taking the vibrant colors with her and secretly placing wrong objects inside his most precious artworks. These objects disturb the balance and harmony of each painting.

To restore order, the player must enter the canvases, explore their inner worlds, correct what does not belong, and find a way back to the picture frame.

Game Description

Painted Worlds is a first-person 3D cozy game focused on exploration, physics-based puzzles, and color interaction.

The game features three hand-crafted paintings connected by a mystical ring-shaped gallery. Each painting represents a unique 3D world in which the laws of artistic harmony have been broken.

Guided by glowing stars and memories of the lost muse, the player must identify objects that do not belong, restore their correct colors through a color-mixing mini-game, reactivate them using Magical Balls, and trigger physics-based chain reactions to solve puzzles.

Examples of interactions include toppling a book to create a step, using a giant knife as a lever or catapult, and manipulating gifts or wooden beams to reach the exit.

As the game progresses, the puzzles increase in complexity and require careful observation and creative problem-solving. The original paintings are always available as visual hints to guide the player.
